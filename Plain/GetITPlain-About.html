<h2><b><i>About Us</i></b></h2>
<p>GetIT was founded by Sir Netwon deGrasse Nye in the 1980s, the founder worked on it in an abandoned Mineshaft where He had to fight off his own delusions as he was schizophrenic.<br>
After many years in the abandoned Mineshaft, the founder got out and showed the world his intentions. This intention was GetIt, over 20 years the founder worked hard for GetIT to be successful, due to the advancement of technology GetIT rose to the top, selling its services to big companies like YouTube, Amazon, Adobe and many more. Everything that is big, was built upon GetIT, the founder's passion for GetIt was rivaled by his love of exploring abandoned mineshafts. So the Founder sold GetIT and went to explore abandoned Mineshafts. He has not been seen to this day and it has been 15 years.
